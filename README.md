## Repo for my nvim, Windows Terminal and bash config files

# Step 1: Download Windows Terminal
- Windows Store or https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.3.2651.0

# Step 2: Copy Terminal Config inside your config

# Step 4: Install nodejs and npm

# Step 5: Install nvim

# Step 6: Create the directory ~/.config/nvim/ and copy the init.vim file into it
